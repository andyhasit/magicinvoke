Welcome to magicinvoke!
=========================

Magicinvoke is a Python (2.7 and 3.4+) library based on
`Invoke <http://pyinvoke.org>`_.

It adds ``get_params_from_ctx``, ``skippable``, and ``magictask``,
as well as support for ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` on tasks.
See more `here <https://github.com/haydenflinner/magicinvoke>`_.

For examples of what magicinvoke can do you for you, please see the docstrings
for the `magicinvoke` module and `magictask` decorator.

For getting started , we recommend you start with ``invoke``
and then switch your imports to ``magicinvoke`` once you feel the need
for a bit more power. See ``examples`` for techniques available with
``magicinvoke``.
