This is forked replacement of invoke.
It adds the following features:

Add make-like skip_if task-decorator parameter to allow smarter deduping. #578 
Currently un-used, even by @skippable, but was tested very thoroughly in
an older version of @skippable that subtasked Task.

Add *args **kwargs support for tasks. #582 
    This may not actually be in this code-base, but the patch is there on
    pyinvoke's PR #582, and should be easy enough to merge back here.

Add error message when can't find specified config #581 
    If you do `invoke -f myconfig.py` with current invoke version, you don't
    get an error if that file doesn't exist. We fixed that.

Change kwargs to task behavior. In original invoke, all parameters were always
passed to a function, even if user didn't supply one (it just fell to default).
This made @get_params_from_ctx impossible, as we couldn't tell if user passed
us something or not. So, we patched that.
